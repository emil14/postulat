# Postulat

## Everything is Value

* Everything is Value, Expression or Function
* But Functions returns Expressions and Expressions produces Values
* And Function is actually a Value too

So **Everything is Value**:

* Function is a Value of what Expression we can get
* Expression is Value of what Value we can get
* Value is Value of Value
